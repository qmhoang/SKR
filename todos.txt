Priority Goals:
* City generation
* Damage multiplier for different damage types and different body parts
* Simple "Sims" style AI for NPCs
* More actions
* More items
* PC generation

Immediate Goals:
* Zones of ownership
* Facing and entities that occupy more than 1 block at a time
	* diagonally long entities
* More "zones" (houses, buildings, etc)
* Missions
* Traits and more skills
* items give skill bonuses
* crimes and criminal records
* npc identifiers (sex, race, etc)...
* night/day cycle

Long term goals:
* NPC speak (probably using inheritance styled speak tables)
* Armor has multiple coverage for a single part (eg 30% coverage with 10 DR + 30% coverage with 5 DR).  Each part has a chance of blocking.
* the Dark Passender storyline/quest ("voice in the head" will generate missions for player, usually to kill specific person)
* weather
* vehicles
* bullet travel
* animations
* wounds

Ideas:
* safety needs-based stat? 
	* actions can improve safety (using cell phones to report crimes, killing intruders, actions vary by NPC AI?)
* crimes will probably be entities that broadcast themselves to other entities
* security cameras
* to get NPCs working, Work as a Needs?  
	* We have a list of "own" entities that an NPC can use, NPC ai will prefer to use these entities over others depending on weights
	* To satisfy work, they need to "work" at a item, be it a counter, computer, or something.
	* on using these items, maybe the npc controller changes?
		* for example, a police npc when not working and wants to work, "uses" his desk which has a "+work" needs
		* the desk action then sets his controller to police from civilian
* body part misses
	* if you miss (close enough) when aiming for lungs, you might hit torso instead
* possible npc speak tables
	* sex: male, female
	* occupation: police, homeless, etc
* layers in the world, 2nd floor will display stuff on the 1st floor that can be seen (through a window)
